2.1.3: A larger amount of nfft freq bins speeds up the OLA due to shorter for loop. 
High similarity of the signals

2.2.3: Non stationary, frequencies change with time. Variation trough time due to words and intervals. 
Peaks in high frequency power due to high (pitch) tones in voice.

2.2.7:
OLA 

Lh = length(h);
Lx = nfft - Lh +1;
