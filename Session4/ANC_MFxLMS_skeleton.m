% Main points:
% (1) Generate the noisy microphone signals
% (2) Implement the ANC.
% (3) Compute input/output SNRs and SNR improvement
% (4) Implement the filter for left and right ears. Hear the synthesised signal

    % current sample, n, in an [M x L] Hankel matrix X_Hmat (this will be
    % use for the filtering operation). Store the samples in the
    % appropriate form.

    % STEP 2: Filter the signal x(n) with the adaptive filter w(n) to
    % generate loudspeaker signals y(n). Store the samples in
    % the appropriate form.
    
    % STEP 3: Compute the error signals e_L(n) and e_R(n). Store them in
    % the appropriate form.
    
    % STEP 4: Pre-filter x(n) with the (estimated) RIRs to obtain the
    % filtered x(n), \bar{x}(n). Store the samples in the appropriate form.
