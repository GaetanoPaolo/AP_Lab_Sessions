1.2.4: For 44.1kHz the micsigs are pretty much identical, 
only a small delay separates both No difference visible for 8 kHz? Normally: Aliasing due to
sampling freq lower than nyquist freq?
Reduce this effect? 

1.3.2: Binaural_sig2 and binaural_sig3 have one of each binaural speech isgnals that gets cancelled,
and is inaudible compared to the overlapping one. In 2 this is caused by damping by factor 0.5, in 3 due to the delay.
Binaural sig 4: filtering with HRTF renders room effect due to the RIR included

1.4.2 J must be larger than 2: see tablet

1.4.3: The HRTF delay is the inclusion of the physical sound propagation delay in the room in the model.

1.4.9: Sounds will always arrive at the closest mic first

1.4.10: Sweetspot below 5, due to RIR variations that make the g's sub optimal

1.4.11: The noise applied to the H's gets compensated the LS optimisation of g's => robust to RIR modeling errors
